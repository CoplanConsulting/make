# Make, an open-source WordPress theme

**Make** is a powerful, flexible WordPress theme created by [The Theme Foundry](https://thethemefoundry.com). It is available for free in the WordPress.org [theme directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/make/](https://wordpress.org/themes/make/). And while **Make** is both free as in speech _and_ as in beer, The Theme Foundry sells a premium companion plugin for it called [Make Plus](https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/make/) that extends the features and flexibility of the theme even further.
