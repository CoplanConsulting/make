Basically, be nice, stay on topic, and respect other contributors/participants.

### Issues / Bugs

We welcome issues for bug reports and feature requests. Please be descriptive.

We don't answer support questions here on GitHub. Support is available for [Make Plus](https://thethemefoundry.com/make-buy/) customers in our [Help Center](https://thethemefoundry.com/support/). There is also a community support forum on [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/theme/make).

Translations for **Make** are located in the [languages directory](https://github.com/thethemefoundry/make/tree/develop/src/languages). We welcome new translations as well as updates for existing ones. You can either submit your translation files as a pull request (see below) or in an [email](https://thethemefoundry.com/contact/).

### Pull Requests

Please submit pull requests on the [**develop**](https://github.com/thethemefoundry/make/tree/develop) branch.

Submit a pull request at any time, whether an issue has been created or not. It may be helpful to discuss your goals in an issue first, though many things can best be shown with code.
